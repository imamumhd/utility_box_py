# Python Utility Program

This is a simple Python project that provides three categories of operations:

1. **Text Utilities** → word count, reversing text, converting to uppercase  
2. **Math Utilities** → add, subtract, multiply, divide  
3. **File Utilities** → save text to a file, read text from a file  

The program is menu-driven and runs through the main entry point: `main.py`.
